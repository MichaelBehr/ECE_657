# ECE_657
Chatbot project myself and Fan are working on for ECE 657.

## Main Description

Our chatbot will take a 2-tiered approach. Our design includes an upper sentiment analysis layer, that will inform the model of the emotion and intensity of the user question. Depending on the output from the upper layer, we will then feed the sentence into it's appropriate seq2seq chatbot model. For example, if a positive sentiment is detected the user will be chatting with our positive chatbot model.
