Chatbot project myself and Fan are working on for ECE 657.

## Main Description
There has been a large push in recent years to develop improved conversational agents (chatbots) from both an industry and academia standpoint. In practice, chatbots are widely used in industry as an effective agent to communicate information, assist with specific tasks (like booking), and overall customer service. For many applications it is desirable to have an emotionally aware chatbot (ECA), that can interpret the sentiment and emotions of the user it is engaged with as it has shown that user-satisfaction is improved. An important application that has been rarely explored to this date, is the usage of a empathetic, counselling conversational agent. To this end, in this paper we propose the Empathetic Conversational Agent (ECA) which is designed to have emotional and empathetic responses to the user. ECA is built upon a sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) model utilizing LSTM layers, and is trained on specifically designed empathetic dialogue corpus. Most importantly, ECA utilizes emotion enriched word embeddings that are built off of the global vectors for word representation (GloVe) embeddings. The combination of these factors allows ECA to adjust its tone and responses in an empathetic manner. We compared ECA to a baseline chatbot trained on the cornell movie dialogue corpus and found ECA to have superior performance when handling emotion sensitive questions. Additionally, we evaluated ECA using a human-subject experience N=5 participants over the course of a couple days of interactions. Overall, our results demonstrate that participants reported a more satisfactory/positive mood report when interacting when ECA vs a baseline conversational agent.
